# CSC207-PetMatch

### Problem domain:
Our project focuses on pet adoption and pet-related social interactions. This domain involves helping people find and adopt the right pets for their lifestyles while also facilitating social connections between pet owners and potential adopters. Our chosen domain addresses pet overpopulation, animal welfare, and community building.

### Project description: 
Our team is considering developing a project that uses the Pet Finder API to create a platform for pet adoption and social networking centered around pets. We will include the following functionalities:

1. Pet Adoption Matching: Users will be able to input their preferences, such as pet type (e.g., dog, cat, rabbit), breed, size, age, and activity level. The app will use this information to provide them with a list of potential pets available for adoption that match their criteria.

2. Chat Functionality: To enhance the adoption process, we will incorporate a chat feature that allows users interested in adopting a pet to communicate directly with the pet's current owner or the adoption agency. 

3. Social Networking: Users can create profiles for their pets and connect with other pet owners in their area or with similar pet interests. The app will recommend chats and other animal profiles based on user preferences and location. To foster community among pet owners of the same breed, the app will enable group chats where users owning pets of the same breed can discuss breed-specific topics, share advice, and arrange meetups.

Overall, our application aims to simplify the pet adoption process by providing a user-friendly interface for finding and communicating with potential adopters or pet owners. Additionally, it seeks to create a pet-loving community where users can share their passion for animals and provide support and guidance to each other! :)

### Example Code (in src/api/CodeSnippet.Java) Output:
"German Shepherd Dog"


## Technical Problems: 
While we are still at the early stages of development and may run into unexpected problems in the future, our main technical problem at the moment is generating an access token from Java automatically. The access tokens we are currently using is authorized and retrieved from third-party tools, such as Postman, which are limited in terms of time. However, we are currently facing difficulties integrating the OAuth system used by the API into Java code, which is the main challenge we are currently working to solve.
